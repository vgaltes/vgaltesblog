My good friend [Edu Ferro](https://twitter.com/eferro) has a very nice blog called [eferro's random stuff](http://www.eferro.net/) in which he posts the most interesting blogs, talks and podcasts he's read, viewed and heard lately. I like the idea and, now that I have a bit more free time, I'll try to do the same, at least once every month. I'm not going to post here podcasts and talks, basically because all the ones I listen I get them from Edu's blog, so I'm just going to concentrate in blogs. Let's start!

I'm going to start with a super-interesting and in-depth series of blogs about event streaming, from [Neil Avery](https://twitter.com/avery_neil).

In the [first](https://www.confluent.io/blog/journey-to-event-driven-part-1-why-event-first-thinking-changes-everything) post, Neil explains why he thinks we need to embrace event-first thinking, and more especifically, event streaming. The benefits of this approach are Decoupling, Encapsulation, Inverted knowledge, Evolutionary change and Event sourcing. Another benefit is evolutionary architecture.

In the [second](https://www.confluent.io/blog/journey-to-event-driven-part-2-programming-models-event-driven-architecture) post, Neil goes deeper in this approach and describes the different styles of event-driven architectures and compares them. He also provides a high-level data flow of a payment system using this approach.

In the [third](https://www.confluent.io/blog/journey-to-event-driven-part-3-affinity-between-events-streams-serverless) post, Neil describes how FaaS functions fit into the event streaming model, exploring their characteristics to see when they can work in this model and where they can't.

Finally, in the [fourth](https://www.confluent.io/blog/journey-to-event-driven-part-4-four-pillars-of-event-streaming-microservices) post, Neil explains the four pillars of event-streaming microservices. At the end of the article, he describes more deeply how we can implement a payment system using event streaming.

In summary, a great in depth series of articles about event streaming with lots of references to spend some more days reading. Enjoy!!
