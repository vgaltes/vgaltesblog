<p>Last Saturday (January 17th) the <a title="Bilbostack" href="http://bilbostack.com/" target="_blank">Bilbostack </a>conference was held in Bilbao. It was the fourth edition of this conference and it was a complete success. I'm really glad to be part of the organisation of <a title="Bilbostack" href="http://bilbostack.com/" target="_blank">Bilbostack</a>, sharing this responsibility with <a title="Ibon Landa" href="https://twitter.com/ibonilm" target="_blank">Ibon Landa</a>, <a title="Asier Marques" href="https://twitter.com/asiermarques" target="_blank">Asier Marqu√©s</a> and <a title="Fran Mosteiro" href="https://twitter.com/fran_mosteiro" target="_blank">Fran Mosteiro</a>.</p>
<p>I like to organize <a title="Bilbostack" href="http://bilbostack.com/" target="_blank">Bilbostack </a>for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's "easy" to organize. We don't open a Call for Papers. We meet one day in a beer, take some beers and make a list of the people we would like to speak at the conference. Normally they say yes just after receiving our email.</li>
<li>We don't have to look for a venue. The <a title="Deusto" href="http://www.deusto.es/" target="_blank">Universidad de Deusto</a>, kindly lend us two great rooms to make the conference without paying a single euro.</li>
<li>We don't have to organize any catering. It's a morning event, and our sponsors buy some bottles of water for the attendees.</li>
<li>We don't have to set up any payment platform. It's a free event and our budget is almost 0 euros.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I like to attend <a title="Bilbostack" href="http://bilbostack.com/" target="_blank">Bilbostack </a>for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sessions are always great. We know the speakers and we know they are great in the subject they are presenting.</li>
<li>It's only a morning.</li>
<li>The subjects are varied. From development to UX, from SEO to agile, from accessibility to beacons.</li>
<li>The networking after the event is really great. Pintxos and beers with friends, what else can you ask for?</li>
</ul>
<p>This year we had more than 250 attendees and I think they enjoyed the conference. Next year will be best, I promise.</p>
