<p>Last Wednesday was my last day in the <a title="Find an apprenticeship" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship" target="_blank">project </a>I worked on the last six months. I've spent a great time working there, learning a lot of things and improving as a professional.</p>
<p>One of the members of the team, Mark, has the role of technical architect. If you have an agile mindset when you listen the word architect is not unusual that a look of disgust appears on your face. Concepts as Big Upfront Design appears on your mind and you start sweating.</p>
<p>But Mark is a great architect. His duties in the team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>He goes to the pre-planning, UX/UI meetings.</li>
<li>He goes to technical meetings with other companies involved in the project.</li>
<li>He starts thinking in the technical solution of every feature, but he always discuss it with the team and never imposes his vision.</li>
<li>He's accessible to resolve any question the team (development and non development people) has.</li>
<li>He reviews some of the commits we make.</li>
<li>And he writes code!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that the architecture responsibility should be shared among the team. Actually, I think that it was in my team. But if your team doesn't have an uniform technical capability it's not bad to have someone who makes the first step.</p>
<p>What do you think? Do you have architects in your team? What are their duties?</p>
