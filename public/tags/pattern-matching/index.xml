      <description>Pattern matching is a powerful and amazing characteristic of F#. Actually, is so amazing that Microsoft is starting to port it to C#.
There are different kinds of pattern matching. In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at a partial classification active pattern that takes an argument and returns a value.
As its name denotes, is a pattern that partially classificates what you match with it. That means that doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to define all possible options but just one.</description>

      <description>In the first post of this series we&#39;ve seen a possible implementation for the FizzBuzz kata.Â In particular, we&#39;ve finished the article with this code for the fizzBuzz function:
https://gist.github.com/vgaltes/edafb6efc55273543a1d
We&#39;ve applied a Tuple pattern to match the tuple created in the match part. We&#39;ve also applied Wildcard matching to discard the values we are not interested in.
In this article we&#39;re going to see how we can solve this problem using another flavors of Pattern-Matching.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday I started a book club with my friends Samir Talwar and Pedro Moreira Santos (both of them working at Codurance). The book we&#39;ve choseen is &#34;The book of F#&#34;, because we want to learn F#.
After reading the first three chapters we decided to make the FizzBuzz kata to start practicing. In this article I&#39;m going to explain you how we solved the kata trying to explain all the F# syntax we use.</description>
