      <description>When we write unit tests we usually try to apply our great object oriented knowledge, so we try to apply the well known DRY principle (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). One visible consequence of this effort is that the test code is considerably shorter than the previous version. A less visible consequence, but much more important, is that is harder to understand what the hell the test is trying to do.
For that reason, when writing tests, I&#39;m more inclined to apply a non so well know principle called DAMP (Descriptive And Maintainable Procedures).</description>
