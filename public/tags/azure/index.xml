      <description>In the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with Azure Functions, reading the documentation a bit and doing a Pluralsight course. As it happens quite offten, these introductory courses use easy techniques to deploy the code, focusing on showing what you can do with the platform. Although obviously this has some value, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea because, at the end, it will be something that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to use in a serious test.</description>

      <description>The other day my friend Jero wrote an article explaining how to write a Google Function using Javascript. The goal of this article is to do the same exercise but using Azure Functions and F#.
First steps First of all, you will need to set up a couple of things. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, both of them are free. First of all you&amp;rsquo;ll need an Azure account. You can create one for free and have Â£150 credit (and you&amp;rsquo;re not going to spend a single pound doing this exercise).</description>
