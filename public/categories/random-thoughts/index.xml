      <description>Last Wednesday was my last day in the project I worked on the last six months. I&#39;ve spent a great time working there, learning a lot of things and improving as a professional.
One of the members of the team, Mark, has the role of technical architect. If you have an agile mindset when you listen the word architect is not unusual that a look of disgust appears on your face.</description>

      <description>According to Wikipedia, in some cultures the term professional is used as shorthand to describe a particular social stratum of well-educated workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy and who are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. According to Google Analytics you probably come from one of these cultures.
I have to admit that when I started to hear the term Craftsmanship I was distrusting, maybe because some of the people that used it tried to use it as a label to put themselves in a higher level than the rest of us.</description>

      <description>Imagine you &#34;manage&#34; a development team. Imagine you reach to have a product that your client is reasonably happy with it. Imagine that the architecture of the application is a mess. Imagine that you don&#39;t have any test. Imagine that the performance of the application is clearly improvable. Imagine that you can improve the user experience a lot. Imagine that you UI layer is made in a 14 years old technology.</description>
